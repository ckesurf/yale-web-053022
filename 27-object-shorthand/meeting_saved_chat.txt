	JS is overall syntactic vinegar ngl
10:15:34 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	Wait completely off topic but are instances of classes in JS also called objects? Kinda confusing if true lol
10:20:05 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	But in that case we are no longer able to use the variable/object called “title”?
10:20:37 From Eten to Everyone:
	King crab?
10:21:37 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	Change keys
10:22:23 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	Yeah, that was I was wondering!
10:22:28 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	With “=“ sign?
10:22:34 From Eten to Everyone:
	Just replace them with what we need
10:22:41 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	change the variable names
10:22:45 From Eten to Everyone:
	Like the names
10:23:05 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	Oh! that would be much easier
10:24:04 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	But why did we name like titleInput”
10:24:10 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	In the first place?
10:24:19 From Eten to Everyone:
	^^
10:27:41 From Eten to Everyone:
