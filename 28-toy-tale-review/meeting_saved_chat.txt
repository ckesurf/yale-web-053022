14:06:24 From Eten to Everyone:
	Challenging but doable
14:06:38 From Eten to Everyone:
	It was the post and patch for me
14:06:44 From Eten to Everyone:
	That part I need to review
14:09:11 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	Is the onDOMContentLoaded necessary, i noticed it’s not in the lecture code
14:10:53 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	when do put all our code inside the DOM content loader? some of the labs instructed us to do that
14:13:38 From Eten to Everyone:
	Could you explain quickly again how the .then is working here
14:22:03 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	“Data” wan’t pre-established term?
14:27:08 From Eten to Everyone:
	So we have to use append to like seal the deal
14:27:14 From Eten to Everyone:
	Like to make sure its displayed
14:27:20 From Eten to Everyone:
	The thing we want to add
14:31:59 From Eten to Everyone:
	Doesn’t combo work best
14:32:03 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	combo
14:32:05 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	Combo is based
14:32:20 From Eten to Everyone:
	Oh lol so in my mind faster was better
14:32:32 From Eten to Everyone:
	But that’s fine artisanal is fine if that’s the correct way
14:33:01 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	Combo approach is double vaxxed so safety is not a concern
14:33:24 From Eten to Everyone:
	lol
14:42:49 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	We should be able to find the element `form.add-toy-form` ?

15:02:45 From Eten to Everyone:
	Ohhhh ok !
15:03:35 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	In the readme, there was “Accept” for the headers
15:06:06 From Eten to Everyone:
	We need brackets for headers but not body
15:06:18 From Eten to Everyone:
	Oh ok cool
15:06:40 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	what else could the headers be? & what does "application/json" mean?
15:06:42 From Eten to Everyone:
	awesome
15:07:20 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	so application/json is a built-in command?
15:07:25 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	like reference
15:07:51 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	okay and could the headers be different?
15:08:13 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	oh okay thank you!
